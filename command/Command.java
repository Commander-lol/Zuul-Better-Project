/**
 * This class is part of the "Go Sunset" application. "Go Sunset" is a
 * very simple, text based adventure game.
 * 
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user. A
 * command currently consists of three strings:  a command word, a second word
 * and a third word. (for example, if the command was "give map dwarf", then
 * the three strings obviously are "give", "map" and "dwarf").
 * 
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid command
 * words. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not known) then
 * the command word is <null>.
 * 
 * If the command had only one word, then the second and third words are <null>.
 * Similarly if the command only has two words, then the third word is <null>.
