id : Ken's Krib
description : The evil wizard Ken is standing in the middle of the room. \nThe sun is setting in the tower. \nThe scroll in your pocket begins to glow. \nThe floor is round and grey and made of stone. \nThe wind is rushing past making it imposible to hear your own thoughts. \nThe sea is crashing around. The spire sways in the breeze.
